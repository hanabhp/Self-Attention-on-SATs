## A typo in the submitted paper
We apologize for a subtle typo in **equation 4**, where there should be only a single **T** in the denominator instead of **T square**.
`P^{'}_h` is designed to be a joint distribution, and an extra division by **T** makes the distribution sum up to **1/T** instead of **1**.
We provide the error-free version in this repository.
