## A typo in the submitted paper
We apologize for a subtle typo in **equation 4**, where there should be only a single **T** in the denominator instead of **T square**.
Since `P^{'}_h` is designed to be a joint distribution, an extra division by T makes the distribution sum up to 1/T instead of 1.
We provide the error-free version in this repository.
